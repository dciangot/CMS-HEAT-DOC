# Deployment Strategies
<span style="color:red"> This documentation is under development. </span>

DODAS provides two deployment toolkits. One is implemented with HEAT and thus OpenStack specific while the other is based on TOSCA standard language and, as such, applicable to any type of IaaS including OpenStack.
Both toolkits deploy the very same cluster structure and they both provide the very same functionalities. The only difference is the orchestration language used (HEAT vs TOSCA). Below you can find links to a comprehensive description of requirements and procedure for the two described cases:
1. [HEAT-based deployment](HEAT.md) (OpenStack only)
2. [Indigo PaaS Orchestrator-based deployment](IM.md) (Any IaaS including Openstack)
